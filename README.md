# Meeting
It is an android application built in JAVA with the help of Android studio. I have used Firebase for this app and API like Jitsi. There are three fragments in the app namely- Chats Fragment, Users Fragment, Profile fragment. In the Chats fragment, users can see all the chats. In the Users fragment, users can see all the users registered in the app. In the profile fragment, the user can see the profile pic along with the username.
For using this app, user will have to first login into the app using a mail id and password. If the user is new, then the user has to first register to the app. Users can make a meeting using this app and invite friends using mail or text message. This app have all the required features for meeting like screen share, screen recording, raising hand, mute everyone, etc.  In this app chatting feature is available during the meet as well as when the meeting is not in progress. Users can chat with all the other users who have registered themselves in the app. Besides, user can have their username as well as profile pic. Users can change their profile with pic from internal storage of the mobile.
